## Description
This a reddit clone application. It utilizes the look and feel of Reddit site with similar functionality. You can create threads, you can join these threads, and make posts on these threads, for users to see. Please enjoy. 

## Notes
Unfortunately, I did not get this project as polished as I would of liked. I only started it last week, and therefore did not hit a few goals, like implementing a comment system, and overall reducing bugs, and improving UI/UX.
### Full CRUD functionality exists for 'Threads'. Note: That you can only edit or delete a thread that you created / or are the owner of. So keep that in mind when testing CRUD...

### Accounts
You can use my login or create your own account.

- Search bar to search for threads. (blur functionality for it is a bit buggy, u can focus / unfocus the bar to make it appear/disappear.





















This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.2.0.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
